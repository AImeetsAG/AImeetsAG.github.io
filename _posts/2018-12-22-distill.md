## Notations

Let $G= (V,E)$ denote an undirected graph with the set of vertices $V$ and the set of edges $E$. Let $\lvert V \rvert$ denote the cardinality of $V$. We only consider finite graphs are in this article, althought, everything can be extended to infinite graphs. Let $d_v$ denote the degree of the vertex $v$. We write $u \sim v$ to denote that $u$ and $v$ have an edge connecting them.

## Graph Laplacian

The graph laplacian $L$ is the operator $\mathbb{R}^{\lvert V \rvert} \to \mathbb{R}^{\lvert V \rvert}$ defined as 

$$
\begin{align*}
L(f)(v) &= \sum_{u \sim v} (f(v) - f(u)) \text{ for $f \in \mathbb{R}^{\lvert V \rvert}$} \\ 
&= d_v \cdot f(v) - \sum_{u \sim v} f(u)\\
&= d_v (f(v) - \frac{1}{d_v}\sum_{u \sim v} f(u))
\end{align*}
$$

Note the analogy with the continuous Laplace operator, i.e. the divergence of the gradient of $f$. In the context of functions on graphs, the analogue of gradient is just the difference along a direction, where the direction is represented by an edge. The graph Laplacian applied to a graph function takes in all the finite differences and sums them up.  

## Voltage

Let's fix a source vertex $s$ and a target vertex $t$ on the graph. We pass a 1 ampere current from the source vertex $s$ to the target vertex $t$. We can calculate the potential function $p$ on the vertices by using the pseudoinverse laplacian $L^{+}$. Namely, $p= L^{+}(1_s - 1_t)$.

## Probabilities

Note that we have negative potentials. After all, it is the potential difference that matters for electric flow. But in order to interpret them as probabilities we need to do som more work.
