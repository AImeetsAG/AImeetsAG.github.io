## Course Description

This course teaches you the fundamentals of differential equations. Differential equations started in the works of Newton and Leibniz. They were trying to describe motion of bodies under the influence of force and how the motion evolved with time. Differential equations describe how a quantity of interest, such as displacement,velocity, heat, population etc. evolves with time.

## Resources 
You should contact your instructor for any exceptional circumstances. We encourage you to seek help from the instructor during their office hours. The math help session is a great resource for math tutoring and are held Monday through Friday, beginning the second week of class. Several instructors will be present to assist you.[Math Help](https://www.math.ksu.edu/student-success/ugrad/help/helpsess.html)\\
